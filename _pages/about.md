This is the webpage for the reading group on "Topics in Optimal Transport", organized by <a href="https://apooladian.github.io"> Aram-Alexandre Pooladian </a> at McGill University. 

The idea is simple: for however long we decide to do this, the members of the reading group will be taking turns presenting papers or chapters from the literature in areas such as machine learning, high-dimensional statistics, and numerical analysis. In an ideal setting, everyone will have at least skimmed the paper with the main presenter knowing the finer details. This is a beginner-friendly reading group, but this would be pointless if there were not any technical details.

As this is a reading group, there will be no "expert speakers" or recordings of the presentations. If you are interested in participating, please email readinggroupot[at]gmail[dot]com to be added to the listserv.

Tentatively, the meetings will occur Mondays at 2pm EST via Zoom.
